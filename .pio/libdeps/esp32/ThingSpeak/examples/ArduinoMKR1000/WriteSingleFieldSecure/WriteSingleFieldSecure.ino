/*
  WriteSingleField
  
  Description: Writes a value to a channel on ThingSpeak every 20 seconds over secured HTTPS connection.
  
  Hardware: Arduino MKR1000
  
  !!! IMPORTANT - Modify the secrets.h file for this project with your network connection and ThingSpeak channel details. !!!
  
  Note:
  - Requires WiFi101 library version 0.15.3 or newer.
  - This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For WEP or WPA, change the WiFi.begin() call accordingly.
	
  ThingSpeak ( https://www.thingspeak.com ) is an analytic IoT platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and 
  analyze live data streams in the cloud. Visit https://www.thingspeak.com to sign up for a free account and create a channel.  
  
  Documentation for the ThingSpeak Communication Library for Arduino is in the README.md folder where the library was installed.
  See https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/index.html for the full ThingSpeak documentation.
