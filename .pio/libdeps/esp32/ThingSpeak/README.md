# ThingSpeak Communication Library for Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32

This library enables an Arduino or other compatible hardware to write or read data to or from ThingSpeak, an open data platform for the Internet of Things with MATLAB analytics and visualization.

Hardware specific <a href="http://github.com/mathworks/thingspeak-arduino/tree/master/examples">examples</a> are found here. But to give you an idea of usage examples for <a href="#typical_write">writing</a> and <a href="#typical_read">reading</a> with an ESP8266 are shown below. Complete <a href="#documentation">documentation</a> in also shown below.

ThingSpeak offers free data storage and analysis of time-stamped numeric or alphanumeric data. Users can access ThingSpeak by visiting http://thingspeak.com and creating a ThingSpeak user account.

ThingSpeak stores data in channels. Channels support an unlimited number of timestamped observations (think of these as rows in a spreadsheet). Each channel has up to 8 fields (think of these as columns in a speadsheet). Check out this [video](http://www.mathworks.com/videos/introduction-to-thingspeak-107749.html) for an overview.

Channels may be public, where anyone can see the data, or private, where only the owner and select users can read the data. Each channel has an associated Write API Key that is used to control who can write to a channel. In addition, private channels have one or more Read API Keys to control who can read from private channel. An API Key is not required to read from public channels.  Each channel can have up to 8 fields. One field is created by default.

You can visualize and do online analytics of your data on ThingSpeak using the built in version of MATLAB, or use the desktop version of MATLAB to get deeper historical insight. Visit https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/thingspeak.html to learn more.

## <a id="typical_write">Typical Write Example</a>
In this case, write to a field with an ESP8266 with an incrementing number.   

```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include "secrets.h"
#include "ThingSpeak.h" // always include thingspeak header file after other header files and custom macros

char ssid[] = SECRET_SSID;   // your network SSID (name) 
char pass[] = SECRET_PASS;   // your network password
int keyIndex = 0;            // your network key Index number (needed only for WEP)
WiFiClient  client;

unsigned long myChannelNumber = SECRET_CH_ID;
const char * myWriteAPIKey = SECRET_WRITE_APIKEY;

int number = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);  // Initialize serial
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }
  
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA); 
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);  // Initialize ThingSpeak
}

void loop() {

  // Connect or reconnect to WiFi
  if(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to SSID: ");
    Serial.println(SECRET_SSID);
    while(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
      WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);  // Connect to WPA/WPA2 network. Change this line if using open or WEP network
      Serial.print(".");
      delay(5000);     
    } 
    Serial.println("\nConnected.");
  }
  
  // Write to ThingSpeak. There are up to 8 fields in a channel, allowing you to store up to 8 different
  // pieces of information in a channel.  Here, we write to field 1.
  int x = ThingSpeak.writeField(myChannelNumber, 1, number, myWriteAPIKey);
  if(x == 200){
    Serial.println("Channel update successful.");
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem updating channel. HTTP error code " + String(x));
  }

  // change the value
  number++;
  if(number > 99){
    number = 0;
  }
  
  delay(20000); // Wait 20 seconds to update the channel again
}
```

## <a id="typical_read">Typical Read Example</a>
In this case, read from a public channel and a private channel with an ESP8266.  The public channel is the temperature(F) at MathWorks headquarters.  The private channel is a counter that increments.

 ```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include "secrets.h"
#include "ThingSpeak.h" // always include thingspeak header file after other header files and custom macros

char ssid[] = SECRET_SSID;   // your network SSID (name) 
char pass[] = SECRET_PASS;   // your network password
int keyIndex = 0;            // your network key Index number (needed only for WEP)
WiFiClient  client;

// Weather station channel details
unsigned long weatherStationChannelNumber = SECRET_CH_ID_WEATHER_STATION;
unsigned int temperatureFieldNumber = 4;

// Counting channel details
unsigned long counterChannelNumber = SECRET_CH_ID_COUNTER;
const char * myCounterReadAPIKey = SECRET_READ_APIKEY_COUNTER;
unsigned int counterFieldNumber = 1; 

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);  // Initialize serial
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }
  
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA); 
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);  // Initialize ThingSpeak
}

void loop() {

  int statusCode = 0;
  
  // Connect or reconnect to WiFi
  if(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to SSID: ");
    Serial.println(SECRET_SSID);
    while(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
      WiFi.begin(ssid, pass); // Connect to WPA/WPA2 network. Change this line if using open or WEP network
      Serial.print(".");
      delay(5000);     
    } 
    Serial.println("\nConnected");
  }

  // Read in field 4 of the public channel recording the temperature
  float temperatureInF = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(weatherStationChannelNumber, temperatureFieldNumber);  

  // Check the status of the read operation to see if it was successful
  statusCode = ThingSpeak.getLastReadStatus();
  if(statusCode == 200){
    Serial.println("Temperature at MathWorks HQ: " + String(temperatureInF) + " deg F");
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem reading channel. HTTP error code " + String(statusCode)); 
  }
  
  delay(15000); // No need to read the temperature too often.

  // Read in field 1 of the private channel which is a counter  
  long count = ThingSpeak.readLongField(counterChannelNumber, counterFieldNumber, myCounterReadAPIKey);  

   // Check the status of the read operation to see if it was successful
  statusCode = ThingSpeak.getLastReadStatus();
  if(statusCode == 200){
    Serial.println("Counter: " + String(count));
  }
  else{
    Serial.println("Problem reading channel. HTTP error code " + String(statusCode)); 
  }
  
  delay(15000); // No need to read the counter too often.
  
}
 ```

## Secure Connection
Securely connect to ThingSpeak API to use the above features and functionalities.

### HTTPS
HTTPS ensures confidentiality as well as authenticity.
Confidentiality: SSL Encryption using public-key cryptography.
Authenticity: creates "trust", the device knows whether it's connected to the actual api.thingkspeak.com and not a spoof of it.

### User Sketch Requirements
Always use ```#define TS_ENABLE_SSL``` before ```#include <thingspeak.h>``` so as to perform a secure connection. If not, then the default connection would be insecured HTTP.

#### Confidentiality without Authenticity
Case 1: TS_ENABLE_SSL macro defined + Client capable of doing SSL = Secure HTTPS Connection <br>
Case 2: TS_ENABLE_SSL macro defined + Client not capable of SSL = Defualt HTTP connection with a warning message sent to the user <br>
Case 3: TS_ENABLE_SSL macro undefined + Client capable of doing SSL = Error connecting to ThingSpeak status code returned to user <br>
Case 4: TS_ENABLE_SSL macro undefined + Client not capable of SSL =  HTTP connection

#### Confidentiality + Authenticity
Different client libraries have different methods of performing authenticity. <br>
Some ways: Root Certificate Check, Certificate Fingerprint Check. <br>
Perform the fingerprint and/or certificate check prior to invoking the ```begin()``` function. <br>
The certificate has an expiration date associated with it, and hence it's the user's responsibility to fetch the updated certificate for the Confidentiality + Authenticity HTTPS connection to be established. <br>
See the ReadMultipleFieldsSecure example on Fingerprint check HTTPS connection using ESP8266.
See the ReadMultipleFieldsSecure example on Root Certificate check HTTPS connection using ESP32.

## Special Characters
Some characters require '%XX' style URL encoding before sending to ThingSpeak.  The writeField() and writeFields() methods will perform the encoding automatically.  The writeRaw() method will not.

| Character  | Encoding |
|------------|:---------|
|     "      | %22      |
|     %      | %25      |
|     &      | %26      |
|     +      | %2B      |
|     ;      | %3B      |

Control characters, ASCII values 0 though 31, are not accepted by ThingSpeak and will be ignored.  Extended ASCII characters with values above 127 will also be ignored.
