  ReadField
  
  Description: Demonstates reading from a public channel which requires no API key and reading from a private channel which requires a read API key.
               The value read from the public channel is the current outside temperature at MathWorks headquaters in Natick, MA.  The value from the
               private channel is an example counter that increments every 10 seconds.
  
  Hardware: Arduino Yún, Yún Rev.2
  
  !!! IMPORTANT - Modify the secrets.h file for this project with your network connection and ThingSpeak channel details. !!!

  Notes:
    - This example works with both Ethernet and WiFi
    - For WiFi with the Yún Rev.2, configure the SSID and password through the Access Point portal.
